Assignement-1

The assignment having two folders viz install_dir and diag_inside_content directory.
We have to find ERROR_KEY in install_dir folder. Each inside folder contains plugins. Which is usually called as Rules. 

So, we have to extract each error_key from this plugins folder recursively 
and match the corresponding folder exist or not, for that particular error key.
And make a two list for directory exist and directory_not_exists.
